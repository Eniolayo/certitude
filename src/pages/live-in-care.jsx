          <h3>Live in care</h3>
          <p>
            Live-in care helps you live the life you want, on your own terms, in
            your own home, close to family and friends. We ensure that with our
            person-centred approach, we will put together a unique package of
            care with a carefully chosen carer. Together, weâ€™ll help you stay in
            the home you know and love.
          </p>
          <p>Live-in care means you can keep the same daily routines</p>

          <p>
            With a spare room in your home, your carer will be there to support
            you each day, as much or as little as you like and according to what
            matters to you most.
